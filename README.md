Rocky is basically an ingredient/panty database. the idea here is to have something you can use to track stuff you own and have a better idea of what's going perishable and what you need to buy more of.

What it really is, though, is more like a v0 implementation of something like airtable. an open question here is how to pull out stuff like the schema configs out.
